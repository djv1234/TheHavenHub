Try deep breathing—inhale slowly through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale through your mouth. If possible, find a quiet space, like a park or shelter, to rest and clear your mind. Talking to someone, whether a friend, a support worker, or a hotline, can help ease worries. Focus on one thing at a time—securing food, finding a safe place, or just getting through the day. You’re not alone, and help is available through shelters and community programs.",
